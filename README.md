# hello-brick

### About

This is my first experiment with a
[brick](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick) library.

An app should look like this:

![screenshot](media/sshot.png)

Each of app's frames shows a separate *viewport* - a scrollable container
for widgets. User can switch between frames and scroll any of them separatedly.

### How to

1. Build using a [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
1. Run with `stack exec hello-brick`
1. ...
1. PROFIT
